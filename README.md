Libft is a project that recreates essential standard library functions for the C programming language. This project includes commonly used functions for handling string, memory, and linked list operations, as well as other utility functions. The libft library aims to simplify data processing and list management in C.

Features
This project includes the following function groups:

1. String Functions:
Functions like ft_strlen, ft_strchr, ft_strrchr, ft_strdup, ft_strjoin, and ft_strtrim simplify text processing.
You can split or concatenate strings using functions like ft_split, ft_strlcpy, and ft_strlcat.
2. Memory Functions:
Memory functions like ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, and ft_memchr help you manage memory and perform data copying.
Functions such as ft_bzero and ft_calloc allow you to reset and dynamically allocate memory.
3. Character Control Functions:
Functions like ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, and ft_isprint allow you to identify character types.
You can use ft_toupper and ft_tolower to convert character cases.
4. Linked List Functions:
To manage linked lists of type t_list, libft provides functions such as ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstclear, and ft_lstmap.
These functions make it easier to manage dynamic data structures.
